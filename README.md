Kaggle Used Car Price Prediction Challenge

This repository documents my journey through the Kaggle Used Car Price Prediction competition. The project's goal was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the sale price of used cars based on a dataset describing 40,000 vehicles. The work encapsulates all phases of the data science process: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and tuning. I utilized an XGBoost regression model, achieving my lowest score in RMSE evaluation, reflecting the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting prices. This competition honed my skills in predictive modeling and offered a real-world application of advanced machine learning techniques.

Final Code and Report are both included in this repository.
